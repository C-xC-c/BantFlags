* /api/post
** Recieved Data
Data is sent from the script to the backend after a post has been
made, containing the post number, =post_nr=, =board= identifier, and
selected flags, =regions=. Modern versions of the script also encode a
=version= which is used when splitting =regions= into individual flags

Data looks like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC http :pretty
  POST https://flags/plum.moe/api/post
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

  post_nr=12345&board=bant&regions=Patchouli,dount,VIP&version=1
#+END_SRC
** Sent Data
The backend returns either a JSON object of the post, as it would be
returned by =/api/get=, or an error message specific to the issue if
the form data is invalid.
