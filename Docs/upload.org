* /Upload
The flag console is the preferred way for adding and modifying flags
in the database. It provides controls for adding, deleting and
renaming flags, all of which are visible before being committed by
someone with with password, which is set using the =staging-password=
section in =appsettings.json=. Changes may be unstaged on an
individual basis, but committed changes must be done all at once.

Flags have several hard-coded requirements for being uploaded using
the console. The image must be 16 by 11 pixels in size, be a PNG file
and have a valid PNG header. Names of files must be under 100
characters in length, and not contain either "," or
"||". Additionally, you cannot name a flag "Empty, or there were
errors. Please re-set your flags." as this is used, well, when someone
hasn't set their flags right.
